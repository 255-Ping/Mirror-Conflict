# Mirror Conflict

**Mirror Conflict** is a puzzle-action game where you fight a perfect copy of yourself — except everything you do is mirrored.

When you move left, your copy moves right.  
When you jump, they jump.

You don’t win by being faster or stronger.  
You win by **outthinking yourself through level design**.

---

## Core Concept

Each level spawns a mirrored opponent that exactly matches your inputs:

- Horizontal movement is inverted
- Vertical movement is mirrored
- Actions (jumping, interacting) are perfectly synced

Your copy is not AI-driven — it is **you**.

The challenge comes entirely from:
- Level layout
- Hazards
- Timing
- Spatial reasoning

---

## Gameplay

- **Genre:** Puzzle / Action
- **Perspective:** 2D
- **Focus:** Using the environment against yourself
- **Win Condition:** Defeat or outmaneuver your mirrored self via level design

There are no random elements.  
Every failure is deterministic.

## Controls

- Move Left / Right
- Jump

All inputs are mirrored by the enemy in real time.
