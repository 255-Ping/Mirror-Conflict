# Mirror Conflict

**Mirror Conflict** is a puzzle-action game where you fight a perfect copy of yourself — except everything you do is mirrored.

When you move left, your copy moves right.  
When you jump, they jump.

You don’t win by being faster or stronger.  
You win by **outthinking yourself through level design**.

## Mirror Conflict

**Mirror Conflict** is a 2D puzzle-action game where the player battles a mirrored version of themselves — every move and action is inverted, forcing the player to outthink their own behavior through strategic level design.

🎮 **Play the demo:** https://255-ping.github.io/Mirror-Conflict/  

This project includes the game source, assets, and build configuration so you can explore, modify, or extend the mechanics.

## Core Concept

Each level spawns a mirrored opponent that exactly matches your inputs:

- Horizontal movement is inverted
- Vertical movement is mirrored
- Actions (jumping, interacting) are perfectly synced

Your copy is not AI-driven — it is **you**.

The challenge comes entirely from:
- Level layout
- Hazards
- Timing
- Spatial reasoning

## Gameplay

- **Genre:** Puzzle / Action
- **Perspective:** 2D
- **Focus:** Using the environment against yourself
- **Win Condition:** Defeat or outmaneuver your mirrored self via level design

There are no random elements.  
Every failure is deterministic.
